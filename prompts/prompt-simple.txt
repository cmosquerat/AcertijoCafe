Create a minimalist square Instagram post for Acertijo Café coffee shop with a dark gradient background transitioning from deep navy blue to charcoal gray to near black. At the top center, place a white coffee shop logo. Below it, add elegant small uppercase text "ACERTIJO CAFÉ · MANIZALES" in light gray with wide letter spacing. Display a large two-line title centered: "Algo está despertando en" in white bold text and "Manizales." in vibrant orange, both very large and readable. Add a subtle semi-transparent white box with rounded corners containing small uppercase text "QUEREMOS CONOCERTE" and two lines of white text saying "Responde una breve encuesta" and "y recibe un capuchino gratis" in large readable font. Below the box, add descriptive text in light gray: "Antes de abrir nuestras puertas," and "queremos escucharte." in two lines. Center a large prominent orange rounded button with white bold text "Comenzar el acertijo". Below the button, add small supporting text in light gray saying "Completa la encuesta y recibe un capuchino gratis". The design should be modern, elegant, minimalist with clean typography, generous spacing, premium coffee shop aesthetic, dark sophisticated color palette with orange accents, all elements perfectly centered, no decorative elements, focus on readability and elegance, professional graphic design suitable for Instagram.
